# Restaurant-Reviews

Here will be a project pre-coded as a resstaurant reviewing application meant for mobile and desktop use.

I will be adjusting the code to achieve mobile responiveness, accessibilities and PWA functionalities.

## Legend / Markers - S1

- __(*) = In progress.__
- __(S#) = "Section" indicator.__
- __(**) = Finished.__
- __(??) = Sideboard. (Things to will fiddle with, but not a priority. Given if this repo is for practices or not.)__
- __(--) = Removed. (No longer a focus, or not needed.)__

--- 
Currently the legend (all sections actually.) section is a experimental part of the readme documentation file for clarity, guidelines, and notes. Everything here is subject to change and does not resemble any form of a official "documentation-ready" to use.
