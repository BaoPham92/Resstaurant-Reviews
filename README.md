# Restaurant-Reviews

Here will be a project pre-coded as a resstaurant reviewing application meant for mobile and desktop use.

I will be adjusting the code to achieve mobile responiveness, accessibilities and PWA functionalities.

## S1 - Legend / Markers

- __(*) = In progress.__
- __(S#) = "Section" indicator.__
- __(**) = Finished.__
- __(??) = Sideboard. (Things to will fiddle with, but not a priority. Given if this repo is for practices or not.)__
- __(--) = Removed. (No longer a focus, or not needed.)__

--- 
Currently the legend (all sections actually.) section is a experimental part of the readme documentation file for clarity, guidelines, and notes. Everything here is subject to change and does not resemble any form of a official "documentation-ready" to use.

### S2 - Notes:
Here will be my personal notes working on the project. Expect random banter. Helps to be writing notes lol.

- November 8th. Minor details really, closing in past 12AM and marks the repo's creation. Nothing so far, added package.JSON and should be adding a tools section on what I will be using for the project like Parcel for the module bundler, etc. Then I will be giving a quick review of the code before the lights are out.
