# Restaurant-Reviews

Here will be a project pre-coded as a resstaurant reviewing application meant for mobile and desktop use.

I will be adjusting the code to achieve mobile responiveness, accessibilities and PWA functionalities.

## S1 - Legend / Markers

- __(*) = In progress.__
- __(S#) = "Section" indicator.__
- __(**) = Finished.__
- __(??) = Sideboard. (Things to will fiddle with, but not a priority. Given if this repo is for practices or not.)__
- __(--) = Removed. (No longer a focus, or not needed.)__

--- 
Currently the legend (all sections actually.) section is a experimental part of the readme documentation file for clarity, guidelines, and notes. Everything here is subject to change and does not resemble any form of a official "documentation-ready" to use.

### S2 - Notes:
Here will be my personal notes working on the project. Expect random banter. Helps to be writing notes lol.

<!-- Notes section -->
<details>
<summary><strong>Notes:</strong></summary>

- November 8th. Minor details really, closing in past 12AM and marks the repo's creation. Nothing so far, added package.JSON and should be adding a tools section on what I will be using for the project like Parcel for the module bundler, etc. Then I will be giving a quick review of the code before the lights are out.

- November 9th. Adjusted multiple CSS for elements containing the cuisine detail pade and the home page. I also added the base general accessibility features for users. "Base" / "General" in terms of what it is basic, necessary, or needed. ie: Time of day? There is always evolving work for accessibility features, I will probably look into the offline and warnings later as soon as I review the next needed implementationss at least. 

- November 9th. I should have also prepared another section. Should be a todo part of the section. Honestly, I forgot to do that in the beginning, but as mentioned this is not entirely a official documentation as of yet. Official in my terms of spending enormous amount of time and detail picking apart the doc and labeling it official lol.

### S4 - Todo:
Things that needs to be done, or looked at. Self pending reminders for code you could say.

<!-- Todos section -->
<details>
<summary><strong>Todos:</strong></summary>
- (*) Review the caching next as we seem to have the base app working to a functional standard. (Has some accessibility, responsive working, map api running as should.). Getting the base template fixed / built for the caching next then we can point out next improvements later for other areas.
